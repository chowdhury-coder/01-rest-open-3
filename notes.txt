Objectives:
[] Understand what RESTful means
[] Write a RESTful API route handler
[] Use Query Strings in a route handler

Key Questions:
- How do verbs and nouns play a part in our RESTful implementation of API routes?
- How do we structure our express routes in a RESTful way? In other words, where does the verb go? Where does the noun go?
- What are query strings? How are they different from other parameters we've seen before?
- How can we use Sequelize to filter data by the query strings?
